# Helse loop

Helse loop aims to improve logistics for patients by providing a route to their appointment. This project is only a short demo. 


## Local Setup

In order for the map to work, we need to have an [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

Once you've obtained your key, create a .env file in project root folder and insert your key in a variable called `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
